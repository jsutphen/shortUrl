This is a basic url shortener made using node/express and mongodb. It provides a start page where one can request a short url which redirects to the provided original url. 

To make it work: 
* clone the repository
* run 'npm install' inside the directory to install dependencies (you need to have npm installed)
* set up a mongodb database and write its connection url as an environment 
variable in a .ENV file (I used a free mongodb Atlas M0 cloud database)
* run 'npm run start' to start the server locally. Then, you can access the page in your
browser via localhost:3000.
